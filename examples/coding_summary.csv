It must engage on new issues in creative ways.

It is not surprising that countries have struggled to develop integrated SDG plans.3 Here we identify the areas of development – in low, middle and high-income countries – across the SDGs in which nutrition can bring real benefits, and where nutrition will benefit from greater action, ', '4. There is an immense opportunity to achieve the SDGs through greater interaction across silos. We must all transform our ways of working to enable the vision of the SDGs to become a reality. Improved nutrition cannot be a singular set of targets in a silo – rather it is an indispensable cog, without which the SDG machine cannot function smoothly., ', '3. In all these areas, there are opportunities for ‘double duty actions’ that can address undernutrition, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of investment of time, energy and resources to improve nutrition. Likewise, potential ‘triple duty actions’ which tackle malnutrition and other development challenges could yield multiple benefits across the SDGs., ', '2. These same areas are the means through which nutrition can contribute to development throughout the SDGs., ', '1. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be brought together into five areas that are critical to achieving nutrition outcomes. These are: • Sustainable food production is important to ensure our land and waters are resilient and can support the diversity needed to provide nutritious and healthy diets. • Systems infrastructure is needed to deliver the clean water, sanitation, energy and food essential for nutrition to urban, peri-urban and rural settings. • Health systems are vital to provide treatment and preventative interventions for improved nutrition at scale. • Equity and inclusion are essential to ensure efforts to improve poverty, gender inequality, education and protections in the workplace deliver universal outcomes for nutrition. • Peace and stability are necessary to ensure conflict is not contributing towards famine and food insecurity., ', '4. Equity and inclusion matter for nutrition outcomes: ignoring equity in the distribution of wealth, education and gender will make it impossible to end malnutrition in all its forms. A fifth of the global population 767 million people – live in extreme poverty and 46% of all stunting falls in this group. This group is often neglected or excluded. At the same time, measures must be put into place to counteract the risk of growing obesity as economies develop. It is estimated that a 10% rise in income per capita translates into a 4.4% increase in obesity, while national burdens of obesity are rising at lower levels of economic development. Severe food insecurity remains a problem across the world – from 30% in Africa to 7% in Europe. Actions to ensure women are included and treated equitably are needed to ensure they can breastfeed and look after their own nutrition. 5. Peace and stability are vital to ending malnutrition. The proportion of undernourished people living in countries in conflict and protracted crisis is almost three times higher than that in other developing countries. Long-term instability can exacerbate food insecurity in many ways. In the worst-case scenario, conflicts can lead to famines. When conflict or emergencies occur, nutrition must be included in disaster risk reduction and post-conflict rebuilding., ', '1. Sustainable food production is key to nutrition outcomes. Agricultural yields will decrease as temperatures increase by more than 3°C. Increased carbon dioxide will result in decreased protein, iron, zinc and other micronutrients in major crops consumed by much of the world. Unsustainable fishing threatens 17% of the world’s protein and a source of essential micronutrients. Policies and investments to maintain and increase the diversity of agricultural landscapes are needed to ensure small and medium-sized farms can continue to produce the 53–81% of key micronutrients they do now. 2. Strong systems of infrastructure play key roles in providing safe, nutritious and healthy diets and clean water and sanitation. The infrastructure that makes up ‘food systems’ that take food from farm to fork is essential if we are to reduce the 30% of food that is currently wasted and the contamination of food which leads to diarrhoea and underweight and death among young children. With unclean water and poor sanitation associated with 50% of undernutrition, infrastructure is needed to deliver them, equitably. Special attention is needed in cities. Urban populations are predicted to reach 66% by 2050, yet slums and deprived areas are underserved, while infrastructure has made it easier to deliver foods that increase the risk of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 3. Health systems have an important role in promoting infant and young child feeding, supplementation, therapeutic feeding, nutrition counselling to manage overweight and underweight, and screening for dietrelated NCD in patients. Yet our analysis shows that health systems are not delivering where they should only 5% of children aged 0–59 months who need zinc treatment are receiving it, for example. And half of all countries have not implemented NCD management guidelines. Essential nutrition actions with substantive evidence should be scaled to ensure they are reaching those who need it the most, and interventions for dietrelated NCDs tested to see what works most effectively through the health system., ', '3. Tackling the underlying causes of malnutrition through the SDGs will unlock significant gains in the fight to end malnutrition. Nutrition is an indispensable cog without which the SDG\xa0machine cannot function smoothly. We will not reach the goal of ending malnutrition without tackling the other important factors that contribute to malnutrition. Poor nutrition has many and varied causes which are intimately connected to work being done to accomplish other SDGs., ', '1. Good nutrition can drive greater environmental sustainability. Agriculture and food production is the backbone of our diets and nutrition. Food production uses 70% of the world’s freshwater supply and 38% of the world’s land. Current agriculture practices produce 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and livestock uses 70% of agricultural land. Eating better is necessary to ensure that food production systems are more sustainable. 2. Good nutrition is infrastructure for economic development. Stunting disrupts the critical ‘grey matter infrastructure’ – brain development – that builds futures and economies. Investing in this infrastructure supports human development throughout life and enhances mental and productive capacity, offering a $16 return for every $1 invested. Nutrition is linked to GDP growth: the prevalence of stunting declines by an estimated 3.2% for every 10% increase in income per capita, and a 10% rise in income translates into a 7.4% fall in wasting. 3. Good nutrition means less burden on health systems. Health is indivisible from nutrition. Good nutrition means less sickness and thus less demand on already-stretched health systems to deliver prevention and treatment. 4. Good nutrition supports equity and inclusion, acting as a platform for better outcomes in education, employment, female empowerment and poverty reduction. Well-nourished children\xa0are 33% more likely to escape poverty as adults, and each added centimetre of adult height can lead to an almost 5% increase in wage rate. Nutritious and healthy diets are associated with improved performance at school. Children who are less affected by stunting early in their life have higher test scores on cognitive assessments and activity level. 5. Good nutrition and improved food security enhances peace and stability. More evidence is needed to better understand how poor nutrition and food insecurity influence conflict. However, available evidence indicates that investing in food and nutrition resilience also promotes less unrest and more stability., ', 'improving nutrition can have a powerful multiplier effect across the SDGs. Indeed, it indicates that it will be a challenge to achieve any SDG without addressing nutrition., ', ', ', '...and tackling underlying causes of malnutrition through the SDGs will help to end malnutrition., ', 'Improving nutrition will be a catalyst for achieving goals throughout the SDGs..., ', 'Our analysis shows there are five core areas that run through the SDGs which nutrition can contribute to, and in turn, benefit from: • sustainable food production • strong systems of infrastructure • health systems • equity and inclusion • peace and stability., ', ""We have known for some time that actions delivered through the ‘nutrition sector’ alone can only go so far. For example, delivering the 10 interventions that address stunting directly would only reduce stunting globally by 20%. The SDGs are telling us loud and clear: we must deliver multiple goals through shared action. Nutrition is part of that shared action. Action on nutrition is needed to achieve goals across the SDGs, and, in turn, action throughout the SDGs is needed to address the causes of malnutrition. If we can work together to build connections through the SDG system, we will ensure that the 2016–2025 Decade of Action on Nutrition declared by the UN will be a 'Decade of Transformative Impact'., ""]","['People do not live their lives in health sectors or education sectors or infrastructure sectors, arranged in tidy compartments.

These have been associated with positive outcomes when consumed in pregnancy including better child development and lower risk of preeclampsia/early preterm delivery, and with better cardiovascular health when consumed in adulthood.18 Yet there are trade-offs: as humans eat more fish from fisheries, fish stocks will be depleted if fisheries are not sustainably managed, resulting in detrimental environmental outcomes with repercussions for the diets of future generations.19, ', 'Some interactions between targets are ‘constraining’ or ‘counteracting’, meaning that they inhibit the achievement of another.2 Achieving one SDG may not always lead to positive outcomes of other SDGs.

While historically agriculture has focused on growing enough staple crops to produce sufficient food through highly-specialised farms and landscapes, more diverse landscapes yield both more food and a lot more nutrients (Figure 3.3).20 Recent evidence shows 53–81% of key micronutrients are produced by small and medium farms, which make up 84% of all farms and 33% of the land areas globally and tend to be more diverse than larger farms.21 This partly reflects geography – most farms in the Americas are large, most in Africa small and many in Asia in the middle. But this shows it is especially critical that food policy in regions where investment is being made to increase production focuses strongly on maintaining diversity. It is also vital that policy works to ensure diverse production actually translates into better diets. For while there is some evidence of a positive relationship between the number of crop species grown on farms and the food group diversity of households,22 diverse production systems do not necessarily translate into diverse diets if producers sell this diversity, or if the infrastructure is not there to get it to markets accessible to the people who need it most.23 Moreover, nutritious foods produced by agriculture may be diverted into less nutritious, less healthy foods such as wholegrains into refined grains, or maize into soda.24 This is why it is necessary to consider the whole food system when assessing the associations between sustainable food production and what we eat, as described in the following section (and Figure 3.4)., MISSED CONNECTION to target2.4']",[],[],[],"['To date, health services have also done an inadequate job of integrated NCD prevention.73 For example, even in countries that recognise their burdens of dietrelated NCDs, few actually include strategies such as promotion of healthy diets, obesity prevention and diabetes self-management education in universal healthcare packages.74 Interventions for diet-related NCD prevention and treatment, such as managing hypertension and diabetes, are often inadequately delivered through health systems too.

While historically agriculture has focused on growing enough staple crops to produce sufficient food through highly-specialised farms and landscapes, more diverse landscapes yield both more food and a lot more nutrients (Figure 3.3).20 Recent evidence shows 53–81% of key micronutrients are produced by small and medium farms, which make up 84% of all farms and 33% of the land areas globally and tend to be more diverse than larger farms.21 This partly reflects geography – most farms in the Americas are large, most in Africa small and many in Asia in the middle. But this shows it is especially critical that food policy in regions where investment is being made to increase production focuses strongly on maintaining diversity. It is also vital that policy works to ensure diverse production actually translates into better diets. For while there is some evidence of a positive relationship between the number of crop species grown on farms and the food group diversity of households,22 diverse production systems do not necessarily translate into diverse diets if producers sell this diversity, or if the infrastructure is not there to get it to markets accessible to the people who need it most.23 Moreover, nutritious foods produced by agriculture may be diverted into less nutritious, less healthy foods such as wholegrains into refined grains, or maize into soda.24 This is why it is necessary to consider the whole food system when assessing the associations between sustainable food production and what we eat, as described in the following section (and Figure 3.4)., MISSED CONNECTION to target2.4', 'Climate change also affects fisheries (SDG 14) through changes in ocean temperatures, salinity, oxygen and acidification levels, and freshwater temperatures and water level.16 Fish are estimated to provide 17% of the global population’s intake of protein and provide calcium, iron, zinc, iodine, vitamins A and D and omega-3 fatty acids.17 Fatty fish sourced primarily from fisheries are the primary dietary source of long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids.

Future research could thus facilitate bottom-up driven integration by exposing the nitty-gritty practicalities of measuring progress toward the SDGs in a diverse set of cities [119] and providing practice-based insights into what makes sense, where, and why., ', 'he untapped potential for a cross-jurisdictional approach to the 2030 Agenda implementation—whereby cities and local communities work in concert with states and international institutions—is one of the key messages of the paper., ', 'The analysis of the 260 UFSS indicators side by side the over 230 SDG indicators exposed a landscape of multiple opportunities for an integrated approach to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and streamline connections with the New Urban Agenda [114] adopted at the Habitat III conference in October 2016. Numerous areas of alignment, overlap, and potential extension of monitoring activities exist and offer avenues for a unified, multi-scale inventory of sustainability metrics and the basis for more influential local-global partnerships for the goals. In addition to the policy implications of specific overlaps and discontinuities between UFSS and SDG indicators discussed above, this finding offers several broader takeaways for future policy and practice., ', 'Lastly, the spatial dimension of food insecurity and the importance of healthy nutrition for school-aged children are two central UFSS monitoring areas without an adequate parallel in SDG indicators. The extent to which current fresh food infrastructure meets the needs of low-income individuals and to which anti-hunger subsidies support healthy diets are important markers for tracking progress toward SDG 2 in a systemic fashion. SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2 can be extended and complemented by UFSS indicators such as the rate of acceptance of government nutrition assistance benefits at farmers markets or participation of low-income women and seniors in fresh food retail—a monitoring priority for all UFSS examined. Target 2.2 which focuses on malnutrition writ large, yet its indicators track nutrition outcomes for children under 5 years of age only and leave out school-aged youth. Urban food strategies and their implementation through local health and education departments are, therefore, well positioned to fill this gap and amend the current decoupling of SDG 2 and SDG 4 in the global indicator framework. Given that healthy school nutrition is key to improved cognitive functions and learning [83,84,113] and the development of a healthy lifestyle in adult life, this potential synergy is of strategic importance., ', 'One further area where UFSS indicators can effectively aid the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is target 2.4 addressing sustainable food production within SDG 2. While an emphasis on the environmental dimension of agricultural practices is understandable, the type and quality of systems and infrastructures used for large-scale animal husbandry operations is as key. Supporting farming practices prioritizing humanely raised, hormone- and antibiotics-free cattle, hogs, fish, poultry, and dairy cows is an effort undertaken by a growing number of public and private institutions worldwide and cannot be decoupled from the 2030 Agenda and its food system-related goals. Indicators like the density of animals per farm (Los Angeles) point to ways in which this gap can be addressed. What is more, consideration of animal welfare can help tracking achievement of sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12) not only based on the extent of material footprints (target 12.2) but also on their quality., ', 'For instance, government subsidies disproportionately privileging commodity (e.g., corn, cotton, soybean) over non-commodity produce (e.g., fruits and vegetables) have important implications for small-scale farmers (target 2.3) and may impair economic access to fresh and nutritious foods for vulnerable and poor individuals (target 2.2). Targets focusing on the achievement of greater equality within and between countries (SDG 10) through policy interventions (target 10.4) can thus benefit from incorporating considerations about the amount of governments funds received by local food and agriculture businesses by type of produce (commodity vs. non-commodity payments) as suggested in Philadelphia’s food system plan. Subsidies are not new to SDG metrics and are already considered in SDG targets like 14.6, which targets fisheries subsidies leading to overfishing, however, as most UFSS underscore, subsidies for land-based food production have equally important social and ecological implications and merit separate attention., ', 'The scope for augmenting SDG targets through topics drawn from UFSS indicators, especially those aiming at attaining more equitable, healthy, and sustainable agricultural production and nutrition, is by far the greatest., ', 'For instance, cities have a key role to play in halting biodiversity loss (SDG 15, target 15.4) and the Red List Index can be usefully expanded through community-level indicators such as the number of urban agriculture projects that grow native or pollinator plants tracked in Toronto or the number of registered beekeepers tracked in Los Angeles., ', 'Similarly, target 14.1, focusing on the prevention and reduction of marine pollution from land-based activities, can benefit from considering not only the amount of coastal damage and waste but also the volume of sewage diverted from waterways (New York), or the presence and extent of rivers and streams impaired for aquatic life (Philadelphia)., ', 'focusing on a single issue or dimension of the target., ', 'n addition to nested monitoring practices and indicators, UFSS indicators can help strengthen SDG implementation also by bridging the gap between comprehensive SDG targets and SDG indicators, ', 'It should be however noted, that, unlike the recently-agreed global SDG indicators, many UFSS indicators (e.g., median farm size in the urban foodshed or percent of last-mile food distribution trips originating in the city) are better viewed as potential means to SDG implementation rather than target-specific metrics for tracking the achievement of an SDG., ']",[],"['Finally, a target-level assessment was conducted to uncover potential synergies between UFFS indicators and the new global indicator framework [66] vis-à-vis each SDG target. Each UFSS indicator was thematically coded and linked to an SDG target (Table S1) and subsequently assessed against the newly-agreed SDG indicators. The results of this third layer of analysis were then plotted onto a synoptic goals-targets grid (Figure 2) which highlighted the areas of greatest indicator concentration holding a promise to inform an integrated approach to SDG implementation and lay the groundwork for a cross-scale monitoring agenda., ', 'If not included directly in the strategy, indicator data were retrieved through electronic searches for publicly available follow-up monitoring frameworks and assessment reports. Through coding and thematic analysis, the indicators were grouped into themes and linked to an SDG which they may help track at the local level (Tables 2–18)., ', 'Next, to assess potential alignments between UFSS and the SDGs at the goal-indicator interface, each strategy was scanned for relevant metrics., ', 'The first level of assessment focused on the degree of alignment between UFSS goals and the SDGs. A 5 × 17 goal-level comparison matrix was used to gauge the extent to which an SDG was addressed in a UFSS (Table 1). Depending on the prominence of an SDG theme, the UFSS was assigned an overlap score from zero (the lowest) to three (the highest). If the SDG was present as an explicit goal or objective of the UFSS and was supported by at least two concrete action steps, the overlap score assigned was the highest. In contrast, if there was no explicit mention of the SDG in the UFSS, the overlap score assigned was the lowest (for a detailed list of the criteria used please see Table 1)., ', 'The systematic review was carried out using critical content analysis and coding techniques [58], which afforded a three-pronged assessment of the degree of alignment between the 2030 Agenda [59], the UFSS of the five cities, and their respective indicator frameworks., ', 'To be selected for the review, a strategy had to be authored by one of the ten largest metropolises in North America and to have informed (or be linked to) the long-term comprehensive plans for sustainable development adopted by those administrations.

In addition, the financial resources that each of these urban regions can mobilize, make them resourceful entry points for local-global cooperation. In 2014, the GDP generated in each of the five metro areas exceeded $300 billion [45,46], with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion, outpacing the UK for the same year [47]. The marked socioeconomic inequalities (SDG 10) manifesting in each of these urban areas were also part of the rationale for selecting them. More than 2 million people live in poverty (SDG 1) in Los Angeles and near 3 million in New York [48], many of which are also food insecure (SDG 2). At the same time, these urban areas are also witnessing an unprecedented public health epidemic (SDG 3)—between 50% and 60% of their residents are overweight or obese [49,50]. The disappearance of local farms (SDG 2)—between 30 and 50 farms going out of business every year [51,52], and the inefficient use of natural resources (SDG 12)—over 2.5 million tons/year of waste generated [53–56] (except for Toronto generating about 1 million tons/year [57]), are two other traits that these metropolitan areas share., ', 'To be selected for the review, a strategy had to be authored by one of the ten largest metropolises in North America and to have informed (or be linked to) the long-term comprehensive plans for sustainable development adopted by those administrations.

Thus, in addition to uncovering potential synergies between local and global monitoring efforts, future research would benefit from using such contested policy areas as a unit of analysis and from investigating whether and how local governments are coping with conflicting priorities., ', 'The comparative analysis of UFSS and the 2030 Agenda goals and indicators offered also insights into potential tensions and challenges for an integrated implementation of the SDGs.

To mitigate the risk of displacement of community gardens, for instance, the City of New York updated its land-use review procedures and included a garden review process, increasing the chances to maintain community gardens threatened by development (including affordable housing) in the neighborhood they serve; though at the cost of changing their original location.

Recent studies in North America have, in fact, revealed the uneven geography of food access and the existence of so-called “food deserts”—areas with severely impaired access to fresh fruits and vegetables [77,78], and “food swamps”—areas with high density of fast-food and unhealthy food outlets [79]. Through their food strategies and local land-use policies, cities are, thus, aiming to address these anomalies in the urban foodscape. Specific actions include financial and land-use incentives for supermarkets in low-income neighborhoods (e.g., the FRESH program in New York City), new public transit connections and privately sponsored shuttles between food insecure citizens and food banks, farmers markets, and supermarkets, as well as mandating fresh food options in affordable housing developments., ', 'Supporting the development of CSAs catering specifically to low-resource communities and encouraging regional gleaning programs, whereby fruits and vegetables surpluses are collected from periurban and regional farmers and distributed to food insecure families and individuals, are two additional strategies cities are putting forward to make alternative urban-rural linkages more socially equitable, ', 'Other strategies point to opportunities for leveraging the cash grants for emergency and anti-hunger operations available at the state level in the US, to increase the percentage of locally and nutritious food distributed to combat hunger at the local level.

According to this UFSS, a health-focused food system is a system that promotes social justice., ', 'Greater Philadelphia’s food system plan Eating Here (2011) presents an important innovation with respect to SDG 16 in that singles out “fairness” as a strategic standalone goal for the regional foodshed. One of the objectives, and related metrics, highlighted in this area is ensuring fair competition in the market place (Table 17). Besides advocating for antitrust laws to be enacted at higher tiers of government, cities see also a direct opportunity to affect fairness in the food system by improving the living conditions for farmworkers and their families, including good quality housing and access to healthcare., ', 'Cities emphasize the singular opportunity to link labor and immigrant rights through comprehensive food policy at the local level and call attention to the most vulnerable populations in the food chain, such as (undocumented) immigrant and minority workers, many of which are women.

These interdisciplinary professionals are doing the hard job of “shuttle diplomats” [112], helping cities craft sustainable food system solutions through mediating conflict, facilitating collaboration, and making synergistic connections across departments, food system sectors, and government scales. Measuring not only the extent of participation in local food policy coalitions (see Table 18), but also the robustness and stability of food policy staff in city administrations is one area in need of further attention., ', 'Further, the institutionalization of new professional figures—such as food systems planners and urban policy coordinators—are indispensable to navigate the fragmented landscape of policies,, ', 'Importantly, many of these food policy groups are hosted within, or are well-connected to, municipal sustainability and resiliency offices, city and regional planning agencies, and public health departments. No matter their institutional home, local food policy spaces are strategically positioned to guide not only agri-food and nutrition initiatives, but climate action more broadly. What is more, thanks to their deep and broad networks and cross-sectoral competencies these institutions can contribute to a more integrated approach to implementation of urban food policy and the SDGs. To this end, mandating the development of consistent monitoring frameworks and reporting practices across cities is as essential. Following the release of its comprehensive food system plan in 2010, New York City adopted Local Law 52 of 2011 which requires multiple city agencies to report on their food system-related initiatives every year. Since then, five Food Metrics Reports [111] were successfully released, including those examined in this paper., ', 'One of the reasons why the recent wave of UFSS offers a promising field for the implementation of the SDGs is the dense web of nongovernmental, quasi-governmental, and governmental organizations which took shape alongside. In North America alone, there are over 100 local food policy councils and partnerships [108] already, up from just a handful in the 1990s. While still amorphous and unstable, these new political spaces gather and collate key local food system data and, in the absence of an established urban department of food [109], serve as de facto food systems planning agencies [110]. What is more, the planning work of these stakeholder coalitions uniquely ties decision-makers across the different policy silos where food policy is locked-in (e.g., agriculture, nutrition, public health, waste, environmental protection). Thus, the establishment of a local food policy council is a goal frequently expressed in UFSS (cf. New York, Chicago, Los Angeles)., ', 'Neither local food policies nor the broader set of sustainable development goals will get out of the door in the absence of strong institutions, wide public participation, and mechanisms that afford recurrent monitoring of progress and adjustments of the course of action., ', 'Aquatic life is a vital marker of the health of water bodies like rivers, streams, seas, and oceans.

Snyman (2012) shows that on average, each staff member in the tourism industry supports four to seven dependents in rural areas of low employment, and wages are used within these communities, furthering employment and development through the multiplier effect. Private eco-tourism in the Eastern Cape of South Africa has increased employment by a factor of 3.5 (from 179 to 623 people), and has quintupled average salaries from around USD$715/yr to USD$4,064/yr (Sims-Castley et al., 2005).

For example, the Working for Water (WfW) programme employs on average 9,000 people/yr in clearing invasive plants to improve the supply of ecosystem services. Due to its successes in reducing poverty and improving ecosystem service supply, this program has grown from supporting ten projects in South Africa with an annual budget of USD$2.3 million in 1995, to over 300 projects with an annual budget of USD$139 million in 2015 (van Wilgen and Wannenburgh, 2016)., ']",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['In 2000, large-scale floods in Nzhelele, South Africa, resulted in significant social, environmental, and economic damage to the area.

The impacts of these floods raised awareness for the need to prevent overgrazing and encourage sustainable land practices to reduce flood risk. In South Africa’s Eden District, various drivers (including climate change, invasive species, urban development, and land use change) are enhancing natural disasters in the area (Nel et al., 2014). This results in increased fire intensities, flooding, and water scarcity. Invasive species reduce water flow by half during times of drought and more than double fire intensity (Nel et al., 2014). Clearing them would significantly reduce these disasters. Restoring degraded lands by removing invasive species is expected to reduce flood events by 16% in the area.

Promoting natural habitats in agricultural landscapes also supports pollination and natural pest control (Foley et al., 2011). In the Western Cape region, the deciduous fruit industry receives annual pollination services from wild insects worth between USD$29–185 million annually (Allsopp et al., 2008).

However, the current agri-food systems (e.g., agricultural practices, food preferences and consumption shifts) are increasing greenhouse gases emissions and ecosystems degradation (e.g., soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity) (Goucher et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2018b; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019; Zuo et al., 2018). This agriculture expansion and the associated impacts (e.g., greenhouse gases emissions and ecosystems degradation) are evident in areas near the sub-tropical and tropical forests (e.g., Amazon) (Aizen et al., 2019; Montelles et al., 2021). The tradeoffs associated with agriculture may cause a global crisis in food security or environmental degradation at an unprecedented scale (Michel-Villarreal et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). As a result, any progress achieved in food security and SDG 2 may not represent an increase in the sustainable environment because it can be very detrimental to the environment (Foley et al., 2011; Marsden and Morley, 2015; Scherer et al., 2018; World Bank Group, 2015). Therefore, important decisions must be made to minimize the tradeoff between increasing food production and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss from agriculture (FAO, 2017; FAO et al., 2020; Foley et al., 2011; United Nations, 2019). This is a challenge faced by the agri-food sector since a reduction in food system greenhouse gas emissions, water use, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation is key to decrease the agriculture footprint (EEA, 2017; Foley et al., 2011; United Nations, 2019; van de Kamp et al., 2018). The wide implementation of well-known solutions is needed such as reduce food waste (e.g., Rosenzweig et al., 2020), water reuse (e.g., Ricart and Rico, 2019), agriculture intensification (e.g., tillage, pesticides and herbicides use) (e.g., Faiz-ul Islam et al., 2020; Sattler et al., 2020), meat consumption (Stoll-Kleemann and Schmidt, 2017) and invest in sustainable practices based on no-tillage (e.g., Dachraoui and Sombrero, 2020), crop diversification, use of organic fertilizers, increase rotation periods and cover cropping (e.g., Feng et al., 2018)thatarebeneficial to increase the crop resilience to pests (e.g., Murrell, 2017) and can increase yield, as observed in several works (e.g., Huang et al., 2018; Beillouin et al., 2019; Jat et al., 2019). In addition, more efforts are needed to increase food quality, a target that can be achieved using sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., Lampridi et al., 2019; Michel-Villarreal et al., 2019; Zulfiqar et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the concept of sustainable development is multidimensional in time and space and is achieved if there is socioeconomic development and environmental protection (Allen and Prosperi, 2016). Remarkably, the solutions to the long-term sustainability and food supply require adopting sustainable agricultural practices as an effective strategy with reduced environmental impact (Allen and Prosperi, 2016; EEA, 2017; Wu et al., 2014). It is essential to promote local, diverse, and sustainable agriculture that respects the environment and understanding international trade as a complement to local production. The local and national systems need to be strengthened to adapt to the climate crisis and diversify the farmed products. Crop diversity can reduce crop vulnerability to pests and diseases risks, open markets for different food crops, break their dependence on commercial crops, increase biodiversity, and reduce the impacts on climate change (The Royal Society, 2009). In addition, the success of agricultural transformation depends mainly on smallholders’ capacity to adopt sustainable practices and adapt to climate change (FAO, 2017; Li et al., 2020). All in all, the effectiveness of research, policies, planning, and investment to build a resilient agricultural system and increase food production depends on local and global challenges and how they mitigate the tradeoffs caused by food production (The Royal Society, 2009)., ', 'actors such as pests and pathogens are estimated to be responsible for reducing about 35% of crop yields (Oerke, 2006; Popp et al., 2013). This may influence the progress towards the achievement of SDG 2. Expanding genetically modified crops (Van Hesse et al., 2020) or applying organic pesticides (Kalkura et al., 2021) could be viable solutions for decreasing crop yield losses associated with pests diseases. Nevertheless, the use of genetically modified plants can raise concerns regarding human health and biodiversity loss (e.g., Raman, 2017; Tsatsakis et al., 2017). In addition, there are several shreds of evidence that herbicide-resistant crops do not provide better yields or decrease the application of herbicides. The investment in herbicide-resistant crops and the use of herbicides had several detrimental effects such as 1) decreased crop rotation and increased weed management based on herbicides; 2) the application of glyphosate-based herbicides affect soil microbiology and plant diseases resistance and 3) the use and abuse of glyphosate in the last 20 years increased the appearance of 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species (Schütte et al., 2017). The application of pesticides and herbicides in agriculture have been linked to the emergence of several chronical (e.g., diabetes, asthma, cancer) and other short-term diseases (e.g., headaches, dizziness, nausea, skin and eye irritation) (Kim et al., 2017; Brevik et al., 2020). Also, climate change and biodiversity loss increase pest and disease frequency, as highlighted in previous works (e.g., Anderson et al., 2004; Potter and Urquhart, 2017; Rosenzweig et al., 2001). Overall, the efforts carried out to increase food security and improve SDG 2 may be detrimental to the achievement of another (e.g., SDG 3 – good health and wellbeing; SDG 15 - life on land) (OECD, 2020; United Nations, 2015a)., field: efficiency of ag systems', 'he increase of food production to support No Poverty (Goal 1) or Zero Hunger (Goal 2), may have negative implications in the achievement of other goals such as Climate Action (Goal 13), Life Bellow Water (Goal 14) and Life on Land (Goal 15) (e.g., Bowen et al., 2017; Moyer and Bohl, 2019; Yang et al., 2020)., ']","[""While the government put policies and design incentives to induce changes in individuals’ behavior, the farmer manages the farm according to their interests (Foguesatto et al., 2020).

However, the current agri-food systems (e.g., agricultural practices, food preferences and consumption shifts) are increasing greenhouse gases emissions and ecosystems degradation (e.g., soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity) (Goucher et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2018b; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019; Zuo et al., 2018). This agriculture expansion and the associated impacts (e.g., greenhouse gases emissions and ecosystems degradation) are evident in areas near the sub-tropical and tropical forests (e.g., Amazon) (Aizen et al., 2019; Montelles et al., 2021). The tradeoffs associated with agriculture may cause a global crisis in food security or environmental degradation at an unprecedented scale (Michel-Villarreal et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). As a result, any progress achieved in food security and SDG 2 may not represent an increase in the sustainable environment because it can be very detrimental to the environment (Foley et al., 2011; Marsden and Morley, 2015; Scherer et al., 2018; World Bank Group, 2015). Therefore, important decisions must be made to minimize the tradeoff between increasing food production and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss from agriculture (FAO, 2017; FAO et al., 2020; Foley et al., 2011; United Nations, 2019). This is a challenge faced by the agri-food sector since a reduction in food system greenhouse gas emissions, water use, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation is key to decrease the agriculture footprint (EEA, 2017; Foley et al., 2011; United Nations, 2019; van de Kamp et al., 2018). The wide implementation of well-known solutions is needed such as reduce food waste (e.g., Rosenzweig et al., 2020), water reuse (e.g., Ricart and Rico, 2019), agriculture intensification (e.g., tillage, pesticides and herbicides use) (e.g., Faiz-ul Islam et al., 2020; Sattler et al., 2020), meat consumption (Stoll-Kleemann and Schmidt, 2017) and invest in sustainable practices based on no-tillage (e.g., Dachraoui and Sombrero, 2020), crop diversification, use of organic fertilizers, increase rotation periods and cover cropping (e.g., Feng et al., 2018)thatarebeneficial to increase the crop resilience to pests (e.g., Murrell, 2017) and can increase yield, as observed in several works (e.g., Huang et al., 2018; Beillouin et al., 2019; Jat et al., 2019). In addition, more efforts are needed to increase food quality, a target that can be achieved using sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., Lampridi et al., 2019; Michel-Villarreal et al., 2019; Zulfiqar et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the concept of sustainable development is multidimensional in time and space and is achieved if there is socioeconomic development and environmental protection (Allen and Prosperi, 2016). Remarkably, the solutions to the long-term sustainability and food supply require adopting sustainable agricultural practices as an effective strategy with reduced environmental impact (Allen and Prosperi, 2016; EEA, 2017; Wu et al., 2014). It is essential to promote local, diverse, and sustainable agriculture that respects the environment and understanding international trade as a complement to local production. The local and national systems need to be strengthened to adapt to the climate crisis and diversify the farmed products. Crop diversity can reduce crop vulnerability to pests and diseases risks, open markets for different food crops, break their dependence on commercial crops, increase biodiversity, and reduce the impacts on climate change (The Royal Society, 2009). In addition, the success of agricultural transformation depends mainly on smallholders’ capacity to adopt sustainable practices and adapt to climate change (FAO, 2017; Li et al., 2020). All in all, the effectiveness of research, policies, planning, and investment to build a resilient agricultural system and increase food production depends on local and global challenges and how they mitigate the tradeoffs caused by food production (The Royal Society, 2009)., ', ""While the government put policies and design incentives to induce changes in individuals’ behavior, the farmer manages the farm according to their interests (Foguesatto et al., 2020).

This may influence the progress towards the achievement of SDG 2. Expanding genetically modified crops (Van Hesse et al., 2020) or applying organic pesticides (Kalkura et al., 2021) could be viable solutions for decreasing crop yield losses associated with pests diseases. Nevertheless, the use of genetically modified plants can raise concerns regarding human health and biodiversity loss (e.g., Raman, 2017; Tsatsakis et al., 2017). In addition, there are several shreds of evidence that herbicide-resistant crops do not provide better yields or decrease the application of herbicides. The investment in herbicide-resistant crops and the use of herbicides had several detrimental effects such as 1) decreased crop rotation and increased weed management based on herbicides; 2) the application of glyphosate-based herbicides affect soil microbiology and plant diseases resistance and 3) the use and abuse of glyphosate in the last 20 years increased the appearance of 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species (Schütte et al., 2017). The application of pesticides and herbicides in agriculture have been linked to the emergence of several chronical (e.g., diabetes, asthma, cancer) and other short-term diseases (e.g., headaches, dizziness, nausea, skin and eye irritation) (Kim et al., 2017; Brevik et al., 2020). Also, climate change and biodiversity loss increase pest and disease frequency, as highlighted in previous works (e.g., Anderson et al., 2004; Potter and Urquhart, 2017; Rosenzweig et al., 2001).
